<h1>About DaVinci Resolve 20</h1>

<div>

<h2>Welcome to DaVinci Resolve 20.2.1!</h2>
<p>This installer will add DaVinci Resolve software to your system as well as additional utilities for setting up hardware control panels. It also installs Blackmagic RAW Player and Blackmagic Proxy Generator into the applications folder.</p>



<p>The free version of DaVinci Resolve 20.2 includes all of the same high quality processing as DaVinci Resolve 20.2 Studio and can handle unlimited resolution media files. However, it does limit project mastering and output to Ultra HD resolutions or lower and only supports a single processing GPU on Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>If you need features such as support for multiple GPUs, 4K output, motion blur effects, temporal and spatial noise reduction, multiple AI-based tools, HDR tools, camera tracker, voice isolation, surround sound and immersive audio, multiple Resolve FX, 3D stereoscopic and immersive tools, and remote rendering, please upgrade to DaVinci Resolve 20.2 Studio.</p>
<p>We hope you do decide to upgrade as your facility grows and you do more advanced work!</p>





<h2>Installing DaVinci Resolve Software</h2>
<p>Double-click the DaVinci Resolve Installer icon and follow the onscreen instructions. To remove DaVinci Resolve from your system, go to the Programs and Features control panel, select DaVinci Resolve, click on Uninstall and follow the onscreen prompts.</p>




<p>For DaVinci Resolve 20.2.1, we have taken efforts to keep the project libraries compatible with DaVinci Resolve 19.1.3. While this allows you to access the project library with 19.1.3, individual projects created or opened in 20.2.1 will no longer be accessible in 19.1.3. We recommend a full project library backup as well as individual project backups before opening projects in 20.2.1.</p>
